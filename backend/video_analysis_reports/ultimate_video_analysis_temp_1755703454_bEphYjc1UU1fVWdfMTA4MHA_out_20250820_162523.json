    "transcript": " You know what it's like. You got home from school or work and it just destroyed you. You don't feel like doing anything anymore. And so you take a seat on your couch. Maybe you're going to microwave some food and you're just going to lay there and rot for a little while. You scroll through short form content. TikTok, YouTube shorts, Instagram reels, and then a couple hours pass. You don't even realize where the time went. What you watched. Maybe you can remember one of those reels or shorts that stood out because it was funny. But everything else is a blur and your mind feels sluggish. It feels like focusing on anything else or putting effort into anything else is much more difficult now. Well, it turns out brain rot isn't just some meme. It's very real. And it has now been shown that it causes cognitive decline. Study titled structural and functional correlates of smartphone addiction found that people with heavy smartphone addictions have lower activation and smaller upper level brain areas. These are the brain areas associated with logic forming memories impulsivity. Usually the things we think of when we distinguish humans from animals. Another study titled Effects of Excessive Screen Time on Neurodevelopment found that increased screen time is associated with negative outcomes such as lowered self-esteem, increased incidents, and severity of mental health issues and addictions, slowed learning and acquisition, and an increased risk of premature cognitive decline. And the last study titled Digital Dementia in the internet generation said we hypothesize that excessive screen exposure during critical periods of development in Gen Z will lead to mild cognitive impairments in early to middle adulthood, resulting in substantially increased rates of early onset dementia in later adulthood. Okay, that's really scary, but we got to employ some nuance here like I like to do on this channel. And say that the main type of screen time these studies look at is passive screen time. So this is basically short form content. It's content where you're not really thinking about what you're doing and it's very quick and fast pace. It's very stimulating and it's something that allows your brain to just shut off, escape, and not be used in an intellectually stimulating way. So that means, yes, maybe you can justify watching my video essays on the main channel. Maybe you can justify watching this video if you're writing in a journal or you are really paying attention to what I'm saying and that's part of the reason I don't have any edits on this channel. It's a nice way to just focus on something that isn't super stimulating, but still might provide benefits to you. The question is what do you do? Because most of us aren't going to live without social media completely. This is how we're going to do it in the first way I have done this recently is to turn your phone into a dumb phone. All that means is your home screen is way less likely to get you to click on the social media apps. And this is how mine is set up. It's just messages, photos, notes, settings, and Google Chrome. And I actually do this through an app called dumb phone. I'm not sponsored by them at all, but the creator did reach out to me and give me a free trial of it. And instantly it felt like my screen time went down. It's quite easy to set up and there's instructions on the app itself. But all you do is get rid of your home screen, add the widget of dumb phone. And then under it, I actually have another app which I use called Forest, which locks me out of apps. So it's even another added layer of friction, which I'm going to talk about because friction is really important when we're talking about reducing our screen time and getting away from our screens. And it just makes going on my phone way less appealing. Now when I open up my phone, and it was funny, the first like couple days I had this whole thing set up on my phone, I would look at my phone and I'd be like, well, shit, there's nothing to do on here. And then I just close it. And that was a wake up call, honestly. It woke me up to how often I just pick up my phone during any little spare time in the day, like even waiting between like games in a video game. I will pick up my phone. And then when I opened it and I saw that my home screen is just the dumb phone, I was like, wow, okay, first off, I don't even feel like engaging with this second off. I can't believe how many times I unconsciously do this throughout the day. So it's going to be a big wake up call when you download that. I think it's monthly subscription. And there's a free version of that app from a different developer. And I'll leave that link in the description too. So you don't have to pay. It's not enough to just add friction between you and these things. And break the loop, the habit through more things getting in the way of you opening up the apps. You have to figure out things that you want to replace that time that you spent scrolling with. Things that feel stimulating, that feel like they produce a similar reward that social media does. Because there is something you're trying to get out of social media when you open it up, right? Besides the fact that it's psychologically designed to be addicting, you're also trying to get some sort of reward out of it. Maybe it's escapism from your life for a little bit because social media offers that especially short form content. Unless you just turn off your brain, forget about all your worries in a day. You should figure that out first. So ask yourself, you know, when I decide to open up my phone, when am I most susceptible to opening it up first off? Second off, what emotions are my feeling when I get really the urge to do so? And then go deeper and you know, keep asking yourself these questions you can journal about this and ask yourself, what is the real reward I'm trying to get? Is it escapism? Is it relieving depressive symptoms? And there's a healthier version of the reward you're getting from social media out there that you can turn into a hobby. My next video on my main channel this weekend is going to be about how traditional hobbies have kind of died out and how social media has taken its place. And I really do think having one to two traditional hobbies that you spend at least a few days a week for one to two hours a day doing will help protect your brain from all of the negative damages that come from a smartphone addiction. And there's plenty of studies to back this up to that I'm going to cite in the main channel video. So if escapism is what you're looking for, maybe play a strategy-based video game, a video game that isn't super stimulating, that isn't like Marvel rivals were every fucking second. There's something blasting on the screen and did it did it did it your ADHD brain just loves the amount of attention you need to pay to the game. But rather something like a strategy game, age of civilization or just another relaxing game I personally love Rinscape. Rinscape has been a great way for me to escape, but I play brighter shores now, which is also made by the same creator. You guys should play that super relaxing games, maybe even Minecraft. Minecraft has been shown to increase your creativity. These things can help relieve some stress and pressure, playing an hour or two a day is actually only going to provide you benefits, especially a game like that where you have to use your brain. You have to use your brain to figure out how to do things in the game or how to strategize, make things more efficient. Think about those things when you decide to pursue a type of video game and hopefully you don't get super addicted to that, though. Second one is one that challenges your mind. I keep saying intellectually stimulating. One that challenges your mind that I do is reading. Reading has so many benefits. I don't even know if I have to cite the studies. Maybe I'll put a few on screen, but it helps improve your focus It helps protect against dementia. People who read throughout their lives are less likely to develop dementia and have cognitive impairment later on in their lives. And on top of that, you're learning something when you read or you're connecting to a character if you're reading fiction. And I, like I've said in previous unscripted videos, really recommend fiction because I saw something that someone said about fiction that said it much better than I probably ever could have. And it's that fiction writers are often some of the greatest thinkers because they could not put into words a lesson they're trying to convey coming from within them unless they create a character that plays out that lesson within a story context. And I love that idea. And that's why I think I love the idea of writing fiction so much and why I'm writing my first novel is because you really start to relate to characters and piece together this cohesive story and maybe that story relates enough to your life or some parts of the characters relate enough to you that it allows you to process your own emotions and process your own problems so that you can deal with them more effectively. There's other ways to do this. You could do crossword puzzles even maybe some Sudoku learning a new language. Love the idea of that when I was learning Japanese. It was a very arduous process, but it was so rewarding feeling that it was both challenging but not too challenging. And I could feel the tangible results coming from that. And I think that's really important with any hobbies I'm going to go over in this video is it should be challenging but not too challenging. And you should be able to easily feel the results you're getting from the feedback you receive after committing to that challenge and conquering it. The next type of hobby I would suggest is some sort of creative hobby. You want to be a writer maybe a painter woodworking DIY maybe getting better at taking care of plants. These are fun things to keep you engaged and that are challenging enough to stimulate you but they scratch that creative itch too. I think all of us deep within want to be more creators, especially within this day and age a lot of us consume during our day more than we create. And it used to be the opposite for a lot of people even just like a couple decades ago. But the smartphone has changed that. It's convinced us that consumerism and watching things is more entertaining than creating those things ourselves are trying to. For me right now this is writing my novel. It's been a great creative passion project that I'll be bringing to you guys. And if you guys want to follow along as I'm writing that novel I do weekly updates in my newsletter every Friday. So if you want to subscribe to that newsletter get those weekly updates see how the novel is going you can by go into the link in the description. And the last type of hobby is a physical hobby. We all need exercise. We all know by now I think the health benefits of regular exercise how important it is for improving brain health, the health of your body, cardiovascular health, your joints, your muscle growth, you know what you get it you understand right as far as this goes it's highly subjective just like the rest of these you don't have to be a weightlifter. I actually just went to go do bouldering rock climbing yesterday with a buddy of mine who was telling me he was trying to get into weightlifting. But it just wasn't it didn't feel like this sort of progress he wanted to make out of something physical with the wall he looks at the rock climbing wall. And you can clearly see this is where you start this is where you end. And there's a very easily definable goal in that. And then also the process of twisting your body the way you have to and hoisting yourself up on the wall and improving your forearm strength that's like built for his body. And it was really impressive watching his body move in that way almost eloquently. But for me I really love weightlifting. I found that I can grow muscle pretty easily as long as I stimulate the muscle enough. And I really like pairing that with running and sprinting. So whatever it is for you whatever is most enjoyable to you I think is most important to making hobbies stick and the physical hobby here. As long as it is increasing your heart rate and challenging your body through some sort of resistance then that should be what you do if you really like it you don't have to be a super fucking big dude. That's just one way to train. So to summarize everything even a couple hours of passive screen time per day can impair you cognitively and to prevent that increase the friction between you and your devices by setting up your phone like a dumb phone by blocking apps for the periods of time that you want to do things outside of work or income based activities. Then within those time gaps you replace your screen time with hobbies in different categories. One that relaxes you, one that intellectually stimulates you, one that allows you to pursue your creative passions and one that is physically stimulating. And as always if you want to join a group of people who will help keep you accountable towards sticking with your hobbies and staying off screens and just want to push you to be a better person. You can join myself mastery school which is linked in the description as well. We have coaching calls every single weekend in there and you get access to my ultimate self mastery course could help you build self awareness, figure out what you really want to do with your life and ultimately transform your life to someone who's addicted to scrolling and feels stupid when they're not doing their work or they're at school to someone who really enjoys reading and going out and talking to people socializing and building some sort of income based activity that allows you to really express yourself and enjoy your life on a daily basis. That's the goal of the school. If you want to check that out link in the description thank you for watching.",
